# Weather Forecast
Card Style Weather Forecast with Blur

## About This Project
I'm making this apps as a practice to sharpen my JavaScript skill especially in Fetching API and also to sharpen my skill in replicating UI/UX design. The design of this apps is not my original design I just replicate it from some card design submitted in Dribble and Pinterest.

## Technology Used
For building this project I'm using html5, vanilla css for some specific styling, and Tailwind CSS for majority of the styling, vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and fetching the external API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://www.openweathermap.org), and Momen JS for converting the Unix date to human readable date.

## Challenge
There's some minor challege regarding this apps which is the sunrise and sunrise data that need to be converted to the same timezone as the city queried by the user.
