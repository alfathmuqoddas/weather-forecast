# Weather Forecast
Card Style Weather Forecast with Blur (https://alfathmuqoddas.github.io/weather-forecast)

## About This Project
I'm making this apps as a practice to sharpen my JavaScript skill especially in Fetching API and also to sharpen my skill in replicating UI/UX design. The design of this apps is not my original design I just replicate it from some card design submitted in Dribble and Pinterest.

## Technology Used
For building this project I'm using html5, vanilla css for some specific styling, and Tailwind CSS for majority of the styling, vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and fetching the external API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://www.openweathermap.org), and Moment JS for converting the Unix date to human readable date.

## Challenge
One minor challege of this project is to convert the date data from Unix time to human readable date. To overcome this challenge I'm using MomentJS a javascript library that can parsing, validating, manipulating and displaying date/time in JavaScript in a very easy way.
